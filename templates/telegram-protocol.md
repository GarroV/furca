# Protocol of messages to the owner

The owner is not sitting next to the build. So there must be few messages, each one
self-contained (understandable from a phone, without opening the repository), and
none of them may require working out what is going on in the first place.

**Messages go out in the owner's language — the `language` key of the profile — not
in the language of this document.** The split is deliberate: English is the canon for
what lives in the repository, because a repository is read by people the system was
handed to; the channel and the terminal talk to one specific person, in their
language. This file is English because it is a document; the text it produces is not.

That distinction is easy to lose, and losing it looks like this: the channel wraps
every message in its own header ("❓ Нужно решение", the reply hint), and if the body
arrives in another language the owner gets one message in two languages. Which is
exactly what happened after this template was translated.

## When what gets sent

| Type | Trigger | Size |
|---|---|---|
| ❓ Question | A fork that cannot be settled with a sensible default | context ≤ 3 lines + options |
| ✅ Block done | A block is accepted: tests green, smoke passed | ≤ 5 lines |
| ⚠️ Alert | The build is stuck, hit a limit, or the environment broke | ≤ 5 lines |
| 🏁 MVP ready | The finish: the product is running and verified | link + summary |
| 👀 Look | An accepted block changed what a person sees: a screen, human-facing text, the order of work | 1–3 screenshots + one sentence |

## The "look" message: why it exists at all

A measurement of 61 defects that got past the tests isolated a class of 13% that
**no** mechanism of the system catches: confusing onboarding, two rows of identical
buttons, a missing accessibility hint, docs and locales that drifted away from the
product. A test checks a claim someone formulated in advance — and nobody
formulates these, because they are **visible and only visible**. A spec review walks
a scenario, and the scenario walks: the path works, the result is reached, and the
product is still awkward or self-contradictory.

So "look" is not a report with a picture; it is the only mechanism for that class.
Hence three requirements:

- **cheap for the owner** — glance and say one sentence; not read a report, not walk
  a scenario;
- **shows the product, not a description** — a screenshot, not a file path and not a
  list of changes: the point is to see it from a phone without opening anything;
- **does not block the build** — sent and move on; the answer is picked up at the
  next acceptance, like any other answer from the owner.

## Rules for sending

- **Questions go in batches, not one at a time.** Open questions accumulate and go
  out as a single message when the current background agent finishes. Five separate
  notifications in a row is not "responsive", it is a reason to turn the bot off.
- **A question is sent once.** A sent question is marked in `questions.md` as
  already gone; the system sends no reminders — the owner's silence is not an error,
  the question is simply waiting.
- **`telegram: off` in the profile — nothing is sent at all.** The question is still
  written into `questions.md`, and the build continues under the rule "only the
  dependent tasks are blocked". A missing channel is no reason to stop.
- **The channel is transport; the truth is in the files.** If a message was not
  delivered, the state of the build does not change: `questions.md`, `decisions.md`
  and `progress.md` stay complete without the conversation.
- **Sending is an HTTP call to the channel.** The channel is a standing service on
  the owner's machine, not a tool inside a session. The address and the secret live
  in the personal profile: `~/.claude/furca/channel.env` (`CHANNEL_URL`,
  `FURCA_SECRET`). Sending:

  ```bash
  curl -s -X POST "$CHANNEL_URL/notify" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $FURCA_SECRET" -H 'content-type: application/json' \
    -d '{"project":"<name>","kind":"question|block|alert|done|show","text":"<text>"}'
  ```

  Whom to send to, the channel knows by itself — the allow-list is its business, not
  the system's. **A `2xx` response is the only proof of sending:** `502` means
  Telegram refused, and such a question counts as not sent.
- **The project name is the repository directory's name**, and it is identical in
  all three calls (`notify`, `inbox`, `ack`):

  ```bash
  project="$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)")"
  ```

  Taken exactly this way rather than from the documents: the name must be available
  in any session without reading the spec, and must not depend on what the project
  was called in prose. A name that drifts breaks addressing silently — the question
  goes out under one name and the answer is looked for under another, and the build
  waits for an answer that is lying right there.
- **The format is plain text.** A markup mode requires escaping special characters,
  and one unescaped character kills the whole send. For service notifications the
  markup is not worth it.
- **The owner's answers are fetched on demand**, they do not arrive in the session:
  `GET $CHANNEL_URL/inbox?project=<name>` returns what is unprocessed and addressed
  to this project, `POST $CHANNEL_URL/ack` with `{"ids":[…],"project":"<name>"}`
  marks it processed. Mark it **after** the answer has been applied: otherwise a
  crash between "read it" and "applied it" eats the answer silently.

  ```bash
  curl -s "$CHANNEL_URL/inbox?project=$project" -H "Authorization: Bearer $FURCA_SECRET"
  curl -s -X POST "$CHANNEL_URL/ack" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $FURCA_SECRET" -H 'content-type: application/json' \
    -d "{\"ids\":[12],\"project\":\"$project\"}"
  ```

  "On demand" means the skill itself must create the demand: the channel wakes
  nobody and never reminds anyone of itself. That is why fetching is tied to every
  point where a dispatcher task ends — accepting a block, writing the log, going
  back to the state files (`fabrica`, step 4). Without that tie the inbox is never
  fetched: no occasion arises. Verified on the run of 13.08.2026 — an answer from
  the owner lay in the channel for five days with a healthy channel and a running
  build.

  **The continuity guard is the safety net.** Tying the fetch only to block
  acceptance was not enough: while a block runs, acceptance never happens, and on
  the run of 17.09.2026 an answer sat in the channel for 2.5 hours (#118). So the
  guard (`hooks/keep-building.py`) asks the channel itself and holds the turn while
  answers are unprocessed — once per set of answers, at most once a minute. The
  request happens inside the hook: it costs no tokens and never enters the context.
  A hold does cost the owner one extra turn, so it is a backstop, not a substitute
  for fetching at the points above.
- **If the channel does not answer — say so immediately, not silently.** The
  liveness check is `GET $CHANNEL_URL/healthz` without the secret; it returns `503`
  if the Telegram polling has been knocked out or the database is not answering, and
  it shows when the last successful fetch happened. Channel unreachable → a warning
  in the terminal that questions will only be in `questions.md`, and the build goes
  on. Unnoticed absence of notifications is the worst possible outcome: the owner
  thinks things are moving while the system stands with a question.

## Addressing answers: one queue for all builds

The channel's answer queue is shared. With one project being built that goes
unnoticed; as soon as there are two, the question arises whose answer is taken by
whoever asks first.

- **An answer is addressed by replying.** The owner replies to a channel message —
  the channel finds in its outbound log, by message id, whose question it was, and
  marks the answer with that project. That is why for `question` and `alert` the
  channel itself appends a line asking for a reply.
- **`GET /inbox?project=<name>` returns only what is yours** — your answers and the
  unaddressed ones. Without the parameter everything is returned: an old client keeps
  working, but also takes what is not its own, as before. Using the parameter is
  mandatory.
- **`POST /ack` with `project` will not mark what is not yours.** Foreign ids come
  back in the `rejected` field with status `409`; yours are marked all the same.
  `409` is not a reason to retry: it says that some answers are addressed elsewhere.
- **An answer that is not a reply has no address** and is visible to every build.
  Reaching the wrong build is bad, but reaching nobody is worse: an unaddressed
  answer would otherwise simply vanish. The channel says exactly that in its
  confirmation to the owner — that it could not tell who it was for.
- **Do not apply someone else's answer even when you can see it.** An unaddressed
  answer that clearly concerns another project stays in the queue, unprocessed.

Verified in the review of 26.08.2026: before this addressing existed, whichever
dispatcher asked first took someone else's answer, applied it to its own questions
and marked it processed — the second project waited forever, the first went the
wrong way, and both stayed silent.

## Templates

**The shape below is fixed; the wording is rendered in the owner's language.** Field
labels — "Context", "Recommended", "Blocks", "Done", "Verified", "Next" — are shown
here in the document's language, not in the wire format. Sending them verbatim to a
Russian-speaking owner is a defect, not fidelity to the template.

### 👀 Look

```
👀 Take a look · {{project}}

{{what appeared or changed — one sentence, in the product's language}}

If something looks wrong — reply with one sentence.
```

Screenshots go in the `photos` field (base64, up to 10, up to 5 MB each); the
caption is attached to the first picture. **Look messages accumulate and go in a
batch**, like questions: one per accepted block turns into a stream that people stop
opening — which is exactly the outcome the mechanism exists to prevent.

### ❓ Question (batched)

```
❓ Your decision needed ({{count}})

{{number}}. {{the question in one sentence}}
   Context: {{why this is a fork, 1–3 lines}}
   1) {{option 1}}
   2) {{option 2}}
   Recommended: {{option number}} — {{why}}
   Blocks: {{task ids, or "nothing, work continues"}}

You can answer with a number, in your own words, or "decide for me".
```

A recommendation is mandatory whenever one is possible at all: the answer "decide
for me" must be executable straight away, not turn into another round of questions.

### ✅ Block done

```
✅ Block "{{block name}}" is done

Done: {{what appeared, in one sentence}}
Verified: {{which smoke passed — the actual command or scenario}}
Next: {{which blocks started after it, or "waiting for an answer to {{question id}}"}}
```

### ⚠️ Alert

```
⚠️ {{what happened}}

Cause: {{briefly, no stack traces}}
Doing now: {{continuing with other tasks / rolling back / the build has stopped and is waiting for you}}
Needed from you: {{a concrete action, or "nothing, I will carry on"}}
```

An alert without the last line is useless: from the message alone the owner must
understand whether anything is required of them right now.

"The build has stopped and is waiting for you" is written **only** that plainly.
Phrasing like "paused, will resume automatically" used to stand here and it lied:
there was nothing that could bring the build back, and the owner, having read about
automatic resumption, calmly waited several hours for something that could not
happen by itself.

### 🏁 MVP ready

```
🏁 {{project name}} — the MVP is ready

Open: {{link}}
Demo access: {{demo-mode credentials or "no sign-in"}}
Spec review: {{the converge result — how many iterations, what diverges}}
Known discrepancies: {{list or "none"}}
```

## The owner's answers

- An answer is free text, an option number, or "decide for me".
- **"Decide for me"** → the system makes the decision, writes it into
  `decisions.md` marked "decided autonomously", and unblocks the dependent tasks.
  Such a decision is shown to the owner in the build status summary — they learn of
  it even if they forgot the question.
- The answer is transferred into `questions.md` (status `answered`) before any work
  based on it begins: if the session dies right after the answer, the answer is not
  lost.

## Once, before the first build

The channel is a **standing service**: it is brought up once on the owner's machine
and lives there. Nothing needs switching on inside Claude Code sessions; deployment
and verification are described in `channel/README.md` of the system's repository.

1. **Bring the channel up** and check it **from the working machine**, not from the
   machine hosting it: `GET $CHANNEL_URL/healthz` must return `200`. An answer from
   inside the host proves nothing — the port may be closed precisely from outside.
2. **Put the address and the secret into the personal profile** —
   `~/.claude/furca/channel.env` (`CHANNEL_URL`, `FURCA_SECRET`), permissions `600`.
   None of this goes into the repository.
3. **`telegram: on` in the profile** — otherwise the system deliberately sends
   nothing (see the rules above).
4. **The Telegram plugin in Claude Code must be OFF**
   (`enabledPlugins` in `~/.claude/settings.json`). This is not a matter of taste but
   a hard requirement: the plugin raises a **second** listener for the same bot, and
   Telegram allows one. The second knocks out the first with a `409`, and **the one
   knocked out does not crash — it silently stops receiving messages** while the bot
   still looks alive. Verified on the live channel: receiving was down for twelve
   minutes while the plugin was running.

   A separate trap that makes this easy to miss: the plugin is switched on by a
   **setting, not a launch flag**. That is, it comes up by itself in every session,
   and "restart the session without the flag" does not help — only switching it off
   in the settings does.
